Began work in earnest on AVR Biome today.  Let's try to be Stonewall Jackson
and "Do something, men!"  Started cleaning up work area and getting test equipment together.

Started again, have to wire up Mavric II board

Got Wheatstone wired on new circuit board. Had devil of a time connecting Mavric to the breadboard,
need screw terminal headers and jumper kit.

Finally got Mavric connected properly.  Scavenged pin/socket wires to connect
Mavric to the breadboard.  I have the + side of the bridge connected to pin F1
and the - side of the bridge connected to pin F0 of the Mavric II.  I am reading
about 25mv across the Wheatstone bridge at 24.7 C.  If i approach the thing
the voltage drops to about 15mv.

Somehow managed to destroy one Atmega128 Chip.  Thankful to Cathy for
supplying and soldering a replacement.  Had to set the fuses on the
replacement chip.  Note the invalid device ID starting with "103" is fixed by
unprogramming the Atmega103 compatibility fuse.
