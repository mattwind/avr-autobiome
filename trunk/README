This is a hobby project intended to build 
Description: The AVR Automated Biome project is an attempt to create a generic environmental controller suitable
for a small to medium enclosure.

The project directory layout is:

/avr-autobiome
  |
  |
    autobiome
  |     - Header files
  |
    doc
  |     - Documentation and specifications
  |
    src
  |     - Actual source code


Prerequisites:
    You will need avr-binutils and avr-gcc/g++ to assemble and compile the binaries.  A bootloader
    or programmer will be needed to load the resulting firmware into the system.   The environment
    variables "LOADER" and "LOADER_FLAGS" will need to be set to the proper command and flags to
    run your loader or programmer.  dot and doxygen are required to rebuild the documentation.
    The default is not to rebuild the documentation so you don't actually need dot or doxygen.

This uses the standard gnu build environment.  Run ./configure --help to see the options available.
The actual steps to build this are the standard gnu:

1)  ./configure --host=avr

2)  make

3)  make install

To strip and create the actual hex file, the make target is "binary_name.hex". For example to create the
hex file "autobiome.hex" we would substitute "autobiome" for "binary_name":

   make autobiome.hex

To load the resulting firmware, the make target is "binary_name.load".  Again substituting
"autobiome" for "binary_name" we get:

   make autobiome.load

Making this target will compile the project and load it onto your AVR.  Again, please run

  ../configure --help

to get the currently available options.
